Summaries of solved LeetCode Problems

-#252: Meeting Rooms
    Sort the list of intervals by start time
    If the end time of one meeting is greater than the start time of another:
        This is a conflict
    If this never happens, there are no conflicts

-#253: Meeting Rooms II
    Split the list of intervals into start times and end times
    Initialize a start and and end pointer to the beginning of each list
    If the next start time is less than the next end time:
        Another meeting will start before one ends
        Increase the number of concurrent meetings
    Otherwise, a meeting will end before the next one starts:
        Decrease the number of concurrent meetings
-#56: Merge Intervals
    Add summary on 1/23/25
    
-#57: Insert Interval
    Create an empty list to return the result of insertion
    Iterate through the list, looking for three cases:
    * Case 1: the newInterval comes before the current interval:
        Insert newInterval into the result list
        append the rest of the intervals
        return the result list
    * Case 2: the current interval comes before the newInterval:
        Insert the current interval into the return list
    * Case 3: newInterval overlaps with current interval:
        absorb current interval into newInterval
